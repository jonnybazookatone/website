website
=======

My personal website.

The site is written in Python/Flask, so that pages can be made on-the-fly when a user pings the server.

The webpages take from a skeleton structure, which is then filled using Python/Flask. The layout, CSS and Javascript
features are all implememented with the nice package, bootstrap.

The website is hosted on heroku, which is free for low-traffic applications like this.
